## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with:Kyler Blodgett
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW:6 hours roughly
* What gave you the most trouble:Translating the graphs from paper and though into programming language was the hardest part for me. Many of the graphs didn't come out the way I wanted.
* Any comments you have: I still need to clean up my graphs and make them legible





## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flights1<-group_by(flights,date)%>%
tally()
flights2<-group_by(flights,date)%>%
filter(dep_delay>30)%>%
tally()
flights2a<-right_join(flights1, flights2, by="date")%>%
mutate(propotion =n.y/n.x)
ggplot(data=flights2a,aes(x=date,y=propotion))+geom_bar(stat="identity") 
```
The X-axis is the date, the Y axis denotes the frequency of flights that were missed.  

## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flights3 <- full_join(flights,planes, by="plane")
ggplot(data=flights3,aes(x=year,y=mfr))+geom_point()
```
The x-axis shows the year and the y-axis shows the model of airplane. Each dot reresents a year in which an airplane model was created. For people who live older airplanes. The cessena has the oldest model. 

## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```
Ideally I would have the frequency on the y axis, and the states on the x axis and would plot that. I haven't gotten to the code for it yet. 




## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flights5a<-full_join(weather,flights,by ="date")
ggplot(data=flights5a,aes(x=temp,y=dep_delay))+geom_point()
```
Here is a graph of one weather pattern that will cause delays. My Plan was to have diffrent graphs of the different weather pattern using this format and see which pattern created the most delays.  

## Question 5:
I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```
I wasn't able to code number 5. Ideally I would have the frequency on the y-axis and the carriers on the x-axis with the propotions for the regions color coded as a bar graph.
