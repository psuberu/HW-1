## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with:Kyler Blodgett (Also looked at other students' coding for ideas)
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW:10 hours total
* What gave you the most trouble:Writing the analysis
* Any comments you have:





## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flights1<-group_by(flights,date)%>%
tally()
flights2<-group_by(flights,date)%>%
filter(dep_delay>30)%>%
tally()
flights2a<-right_join(flights1, flights2, by="date")%>%
mutate(propotion =n.y/n.x)
ggplot(data=flights2a,aes(x=date,y=propotion,xlab=("Date"), ylab=("Proportion of Flights Delayed by more than 30 minutes")))+geom_point(stat="identity") 

```
The X-axis is the date, the Y axis is the frequency of flights that were delayed by more than thirty minutes. I noticed that the season in which flights seemed to be delayed seemed to be during the summers as that has the hghest point of propotianl of flights that were delayed. I would say the lowest is around october as that has the lowest levels of flights delayed.


## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
carrier_plane <- select(flights,carrier,plane)
plane_year <- select(planes, plane, year)
carrier_year <- left_join(carrier_plane, plane_year, by= "plane")
total_planes <- carrier_year %>% 
filter(!is.na(year)) %>%
group_by(carrier) 
ggplot(data = total_planes, aes(x= "", y= year))  + 
ggtitle("Plane Distribution by Airline") +
xlab("Carrier") + ylab("Year") + 
geom_boxplot()+geom_hline(yintercept=2000,col="black", size=0.5) +
facet_grid(.~carrier)
```
This is a histogram distribution of the various airline carriers x-axis shows the year and the y-axis shows the model of airplane. The dots reresents the year in which an airplane model was created, and the box plots show general distributions as to what time range airline models were creaedFor people who live older airplanes.Continental Airlines have the oldest model. 


## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
state_sw_date <-
select(flights, flight, dest, carrier, date) %>% 
  filter(carrier == "WN") %>%
  distinct(flight) %>% 
  arrange(dest, date)
airport_state <- select(airports, iata, state)
state_freq <- 
  left_join(state_sw_date, airport_state, by = c("dest" = "iata")) %>% 
  select(dest, state) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(state)) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  tally()
state_freq$state <- 
  factor(state_freq$state, levels = state_freq$state[order(-state_freq$n)])
ggplot(data = state_freq, aes(x= state, y = n)) + xlab("State") + ylab("Freq") + geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  ggtitle("Southwest Airline's flights to States")  

```
Texas was the most popular state that Southwest airlines flew to. Arizona was the least frequent state flown to.



## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
flightsandweather <- left_join(flights, weather, by = c("date", "hour"))
flightsandweather <- flightsandweather %>% group_by(conditions)
ggplot(data = flightsandweather, aes(x = conditions, y = dep_delay)) +
geom_boxplot() +
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
scale_y_log10() +
labs(title = "Delay Length by Weather Conditions", x = "Condition", y = "Departure Delay")  
  
```
Freezing rain is be the main cause of departure delay, as it has the hightest median.The higest delay time occured when the sky was clear which is interesting, and was probably caused by other reasons than weather.

## Question 5:
I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
destcarrierdate <- select(flights, date, dest, carrier) %>% 
  mutate(month(date)) %>% 
  filter(month(date)==7) 
airportstate <- select(airports, iata, state)
statecarrierairport <- 
  left_join(destcarrierdate, airportstate, by = c("dest" = "iata"))
statecarrierairport <- 
  left_join(statecarrierairport, states, by = "state") 
region_freq <- count(statecarrierairport, carrier, region) %>% 
  rename(Frequency = n) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(region))
ggplot(data = region_freq, aes(x=carrier, y=Frequency, fill = region))+
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="fill")+coord_flip() + xlab("Airline")+ 
  ggtitle("Proportion of Flights In July")
```
